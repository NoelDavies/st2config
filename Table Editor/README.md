# Table Editor

## Overview

*Table Editor* is a package for edit simple text tables in text mode, markdown mode, textile mode, reStructuredText mode etc. *Table Editor* is very similar to Emacs-org mode table editor with almost the same keys. *Table Editor* allow on easy way edit text table, it allows:

- insert/delete row
- insert/delete column
- navigate with tab/shift tab 
- auto align number cells to right, text cells to left, header cells to center
- move column left/right
- move row up/down
- specify column alignment
- temporary disable/enable table editor
- show integration tests film

For first time you should enable table editor with command palette:

* click *ctrl+shift+p*
* select *Table Editor: Enable for current syntax* or *Table Editor: Enable for current view*

Then when *Table Editor* is eabled just type

    | Name | Age |
    |-

Then press *Tab* key, you will get pretty printed table

    | Name | Age |
    |------|-----|
    | _    |     |

Then fill data and press *Tab* key to next field or add new row

    |    Name   | Age |
    |-----------|-----|
    | Anna      |  20 |
    | Alexander |  27 |
    | _         |     |


By default text data is left justified, numeric data is right justified, column header is centered.

    |     column 1     |      column 2      |
    |  second line 1   |   second line 2    |
    |------------------|--------------------|
    | text value row 1 | 0.9999999999999999 |
    | tv row 2         |                 99 |

But you can explicit set justification with format characters 

* '<' - left 
* '>' - right
* '#' - center

as in next example

    | column 1 | column 2 | column 3 |
    | <<<<<<<< | >>>>>>>> | ######## |
    |----------|----------|----------|
    | 1        |    row 1 |    c1    |
    | 2        |    row 2 |    c2    |
    | 3        |    row 3 |    c3    |

You can change justification several times

    | column 1 | column 2 | column 3 |
    | <<<<<<<< | >>>>>>>> | ######## |
    |----------|----------|----------|
    | 1        |    row 1 |    c1    |
    | 2        |    row 2 |    c2    |
    | 3        |    row 3 |    c3    |
    | ######## | <<<<<<<< | >>>>>>>> |
    |    1     | row 1    |       c1 |
    |    2     | row 2    |       c2 |
    |    3     | row 3    |       c3 |

## Testing

I tested *Table Editor* package under Windows and quickly tested under Linux. It should work under Mac, but I did not test, because I do not have a mac.


## Difference from emacs org-mode table editor

*Table Editor* is very similar to emacs org-mode table editor with the same key binding. In fact I always run *Emacs*
and compare with *Table Editor* to get similiar behavior.

But exists some differences. One of this is Emacs use character '+' in separator line, sublime text editor use character '|'.

Emacs table:

    
    | col 1  | col2   | col3   |
    |--------+--------+--------|
    | data 1 | data 2 | data 3 |

Sublime text editor table:

    | col 1  |  col2  |  col3  |
    |--------|--------|--------|
    | data 1 | data 2 | data 3 |


Second one is navigation between field. Emacs set pointer to begin of field indepent of alignment, additionally 
*Emacs* has keys *alt-a* to navigate to the begin of field, *alt-e* to navigate to the end of field.
*Table Editor* combine it into one and set point to the end of data in field.
